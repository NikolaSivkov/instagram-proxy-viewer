## Propmpt history

```
Write a simple web page that displays instagram reel from an input box 
```

```
try using a regex to get the reelId
```

```
use the function getReelId and show me the final solution
```

```
use the function getReelId into the website you generated in the start and output the combination
```

```
the iframe feels a little too small, can you make it responsive so it fits on phones and desktops?
```

The next 3 attempts reeeally confused chatGPT
```
Can you add code that checks the URL of the browser, and if it contains a path that matches the path part of an instagram reel, use that for the reel iframe
```

```
rewrite the getReelId function to only match the path part of the url, and out put only that function
```

```
rewrite the getReelId function to only match the path part of the url
```

So now i had to give it the function specifically

```
make the regex in this function only match only the path part of the url
```
```javascript
function getReelId(url) {
            const regex = /https:\/\/www\.instagram\.com\/reel\/([^/?]+)\/?/;
            const match = url.match(regex);
            return match ? match[1] : null;
        }
```
---
```
make the regex in this function  match  the host part of the url optinaly
```

```javascript
function getReelId(url) {
            const regex = /https:\/\/www\.instagram\.com\/reel\/([^/?]+)\/?/;
            const match = url.match(regex);
            return match ? match[1] : null;
        }
```
---
This tried to use gpt-3.5-turbo, but it didn't work, so i tried again with the same prompt and gpt-4, and it worked.
```
Given this web page, add aditional functionality that takes the url from the reel-url input box, parses it, and replaces the path part of the url in the browser, with the path part parsed from the input box. you can reuse the `getReelId` function.
```

```
there's a bug, the `showReel` function shoul also be able to accept `url` as a parameter, and if the parameter isn't available, then get the url from the input box
```

```
I need one additional button next to the "view reel" button that copies the current browser url to the clipboard. the code needs to work for both desktop and mobile devices.
```

```
now integrate this into the existing code and give me the final output.
```

I found a small bug, so I told chatGPT about it, and fix it. 
```
The following page has a bug. the regex in the `getReelId` function should also match `reel` or `reels`
```
Here's the response.

And the diff

```diff
function getReelId(url) {
-  const regex = /(?:https:\/\/www\.instagram\.com|https:\/\/instagram\.com)?\/reel\/([^/?]+)\/?/;
+  const regex = /(?:https:\/\/www\.instagram\.com|https:\/\/instagram\.com)?\/reel(s)?\/([^/?]+)\/?/;
  const match = url.match(regex);
-  return match ? match[1] : null;
+  return match ? match[2] : null;
}
```

Notice how the damn thing adjusted the position of the match group? WTF! This is mindblowing!
